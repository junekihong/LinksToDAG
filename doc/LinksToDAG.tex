\begin{abstract}

We will show that any legal link grammar parse is a connected DAG, with all of the nodes reachable from the root. Every undirected edge in a link grammar parse can be assigned directionality, by specifying the task as an ILP problem given the constraints of acyclicity, connectedness, and the link grammar rules described from a dictionary.
