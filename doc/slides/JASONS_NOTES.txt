Here were the notes I took later on practice talk 2, just FYI!

COMMENTS FOR JUNEKI

slide 11: ILP out of left field
slide 14: say that crossing is not allowed, and why not!
slide 24: connectedness formulation doesn't work without acyclicity
slide 25: explain what happens if r_L == 0
slide 27: spent too long?  Just pay attention to precision
slide 28: count "both directions" by token as well as by type?
slide 29: could have mentioned fine-grained tag experiment
slide 29: need some crisp takeaways on the slides, reflected in the narration
slide 33: need better visuals to show the arrows for the consistent solution


Glad you talked faster in real thing.
More big-picture?
Streamline: watch some TED talks and see how they make every word count ...




ADDRESSED OR FIXED:
slide 19: top/bottom reversed from caption.  Explain dashing convention
slide 20: "ILP is NP-hard" -- maybe misleading
slides 21-22: could illustrate the principles!
slide 23: "can only be oriented left or right" - and must be oriented one of those!
slide 29: "occuring"
slide 34: good ending on last bullet point.  But claim was a bit too broad.
